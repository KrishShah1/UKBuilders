Starting with a modest development in Orlem, he built the company project by project — each one a testament to his belief that quality is never compromised and trust is never traded. Over five decades, his vision has transformed U.K. Builders into one of Malad West\'s most respected names, delivering over 3,000 homes across 50+ projects. The values he set on day one remain the bedrock of everything the group does today.',

            The story of U.K. Builders is, at its heart, the story of the Shah family — a family that has spent over five decades building not just structures, but communities, trust, and a legacy that grows stronger with every generation. What began in 1969 as one man&apos;s ambition on a quiet lane in Orlem has become a true family enterprise — Kishore Shah&apos;s children Rajeev and Kiran carried the torch into a new era, and now Rajeev&apos;s son Avi brings the energy of a third generation. Each has added their own strengths without ever changing what the name stands for.
